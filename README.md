# MITHEM

A Python implementation of **MITHEM (Multi-label Imbalance-aware Text Classification using Hybrid Ensemble Model)** for **biomedical text classification**. This project applies **TF-IDF, SMOTE-based rebalancing, and ensemble learning** to handle multi-label imbalanced datasets like **MIMIC-III, BioASQ, PubMed RCT, and Medline**. **In this Repo the code is not in it's entirety** due to the sensitive nature of the work & publication of the academic paper in due. The authors of the work decided to make MITHEM source code partially available to public.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Multi-label classification** for biomedical text datasets  
- **Handles imbalanced datasets** with label binning and **SMOTE**  
- **Uses multiple classifiers (SVM, DT, RF) and meta-learning**  
- **Supports real-world datasets** (MIMIC-III, BioASQ, Medline, etc.)

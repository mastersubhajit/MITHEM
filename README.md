# MITHEM: Multi-Label Imbalanced Text Handling for Biomedical Data

A Python implementation of **MITHEM (Multi-Label Imbalanced Text Handling with Ensemble Models)** for **biomedical text classification**. This project applies **TF-IDF, SMOTE-based rebalancing, and ensemble learning** to handle multi-label imbalanced datasets like **MIMIC-III, BioASQ, PubMed RCT, and Medline**.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Multi-label classification** for biomedical text datasets  
- **Handles imbalanced datasets** with label binning and **SMOTE**  
- **Uses multiple classifiers (SVM, DT, RF) and meta-learning**  
- **Supports real-world datasets** (MIMIC-III, BioASQ, Medline, etc.)
